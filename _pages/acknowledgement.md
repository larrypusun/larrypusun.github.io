I feel fortunate to have met my supervisor and thesis committee members during my PhD at uOttawa. They gave me many invaluable insights on research, provided thoughtful comments, and guided me to become a better economist. I learned a lot from them. Thank you all so much! 

**PhD Advisor and Thesis Committee Members:**

[Abel Brodeur](https://sites.google.com/site/abelbrodeur/home?authuser=0) (supervisor): Abel is my thesis supervisor in the PhD program at uOttawa. He is an outstanding researcher who has inspired me in so many ways. In fact, the idea of creating this page came from him. Abel has published many high-quality and interesting papers in development economics, labour economics, and economic history. Beyond that, he also cares about openness and transparency in the economics profession and has done important work on reproducibility and replicability.

[Jason Garred](https://jasongarred.org/) (committee member): Jason is an expert in international trade and development economics at uOttawa. I also worked as his TA for one undergraduate course, where I learned a lot about being a responsible instructor.  One of my regrets is that I never got to take his development course. Fun fact: Jason speaks almost perfect Mandarin, though he modestly claims he's only at the intermediate level.

[Jonathan Cr√©chet](https://sites.google.com/view/jonathancrechet) (committee member): Jonathan studies macroeconomics and labour economics at uOttawa. After I presented an early version of my job market paper, he kindly agreed to join my committee because he was also interested in migration and the "hukou" system in China. His words of encouragement boosted my confidence in my studies and potentially directed a future project. 

[Louis-Philippe Beland](https://www.lpbeland.com/) (committee member): Louis-Philippe is an associate professor at Carleton University, specializing in public economics, health economics, and labour economics. I took his labour economics course in my second year, and one of the assignments was to write a referee report, which turned out to be incredibly helpful for my research skills later on.
