I am an assistant professor in the School of Public Finance and Taxation at Dongbei University of Finance and Economics.

I specialize in taxation economics, public economics, and development economics, with a particular focus on China.

I earned my PhD in Economics from the University of Ottawa in May 2025. I also hold a MA from the Central University of Finance and Economics and a BA from Minzu University of China.
