I am an assistant professor in the School of Public Finance and Taxation at Dongbei University of Finance and Economics. 

I specialize in taxation economics, public economics, and development economics, with a particular focus on China.

I earned my PhD in Economics from the University of Ottawa in May 2025. I also hold a MA from the Central University of Finance and Economics and a BA from Minzu University of China.

My [Pu's CV](../assets/cv.pdf)(in English) and [简历](../assets/CV_in_Chinese.pdf)(in Chinese) are here.
